# PWA Icons

For a complete PWA experience, you need to add icon files to the `public` directory:

- `icon-192.png` - 192x192 pixels
- `icon-512.png` - 512x512 pixels

These icons will be used when users install the app on their devices.

You can create these icons using any image editing tool, or use online PWA icon generators.

The manifest.json file references these icons. If they're missing, the PWA will still work, but browsers may show warnings.
