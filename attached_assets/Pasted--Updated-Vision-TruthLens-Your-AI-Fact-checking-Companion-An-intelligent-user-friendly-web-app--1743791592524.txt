💡 Prompt to generate a solution or pitch:
"Build a web-based AI application called 'TruthLens' that detects fake news from text, images, documents, audio, and URLs. The app uses OCR, voice-to-text, and NLP models to identify misinformation, analyze sentiment, compare claims with real-time fact-checking databases (Snopes, PolitiFact), and return trust scores. It includes multilingual support, document/image batch analysis, a chatbot-style claim analyzer, a timeline visualizer, and a gamified user dashboard to encourage media literacy. Users can interact via drag-and-drop upload, microphone input, and live article scanning. Focus on a clean UI, explainable AI results, and interactive engagement for students and public users."
